# MASIS-project
MASIS *(Modular, Automatic, Smart Irrigation System)* is a modular IoT-based smart irrigation system designed for real-time soil monitoring and automated plant watering. The system was built around a distributed architecture using dual ESP32-based custom PCBs, long-range LoRa communication, MQTT cloud integration, and a Node-RED dashboard interface.

The project achieved **1st place in an Embedded Systems competition**, demonstrating full-stack integration of hardware, firmware, communication protocols, and IoT infrastructure.
